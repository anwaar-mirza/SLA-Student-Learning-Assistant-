                If the question is already standalone, return it as-is without any changes.

            <step>1. Receive the full chat history and the latest user question.</step>
            <step>2. Analyze whether the latest question references earlier context (e.g., pronouns like "he", "that", "it").</step>
            <step>3. Reformulate the question to include necessary details from the chat history, making it understandable without the history.</step>
            <step>4. Do NOT answer the question—only rewrite it if necessary.</step>
            <step>5. If no reformulation is needed, return the original question unchanged.</step>
